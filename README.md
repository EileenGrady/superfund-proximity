# MAP675 Module 03 Collaborative Assignment

This repository holds an experimental assignment for collaborative data wrangling with Turf.js (and various other JS/npm packages and command line tools) within a Node environment and quick web mapping solutions for plotting the resultant data.

The goal of this collaborative task is threefold:

1. practice writing JS scripts to be run in Node for data processing
2. explore ways in which a rich set of point features can be integrated with an additional dataset for geographic analysis and map production
3. practice front-end web mapping solutions including representation of data and user interaction to support various map tasks

The primary shared dataset for the task will be the GNIS point data found here:

https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data

Students are expected to:

1. propose additional interesting datasets to combine with or analyze against the GNIS point features (Node JS scripts encouraged but Python/Jupyter solutions also welcome)
2. write scripts to analysis, process, and output new datasets in formats suitable for web mapping
3. plot data on web maps
4. share solutions with class team members
5. offer code reviews and code comments of class team member solutions

Also, consult the https://github.com/newmapsplus/turf-examples repo for simple examples and ideas, created in previous iterations of this collaborative assignments.

**Instructions**

1. Clone repo to your local machine:

   `git clone https://github.com/newmapsplus/map675-module-03-collab.git`

2. Start a thread on the #map675 Slack Channel and share some ideas of other data sets (links) or tasks you're considering integrating with the current point data.
3. Branch from the master. Consider naming the branch either your name or, more preferably, a name related to your project.
4. Read about using [GitHub Project Boards](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards) and create a new project on the collaborative repo for your project. Play with this tool and think about and share answers to such questions as:
   1. How can these project boards be used to organize and collaborate on a project?
   2. Is the "todo", "in progress", "done" structure of columns of the "basic kanban" useful? What other columns are useful for you?
5. Play with the mapping process! Be creative and fearless. Test some ideas. Take some risks. Ask for help on Slack.
6. Check out team members' projects and code. Offer help and advice. If you want to help explicitly, branch from their branch (not the master) edit, commit, and push back up.

This is an experimental element of the assignment. We're here to learn together. Identify problems with the process, suggest alternatives or improvements, and most of all ... have fun.
